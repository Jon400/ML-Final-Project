### Overview on Our project-
based on the classification of a photo page in social networks by categories : beauty, fashion, fitness, food, family.

### The database we worked with:
Consists of a large amount of screenshots from as many Instagram pages as possible which will expand the database and the amount of classification tests we can perform. This way we will actually increase the chance of a good classification and the maximum result

### How did we do it?
In order to classify we used several classification algorithms such as: 

#### SVM: 
This model is based on the separation of vectors with maximum spacing. This model allows the separation of high-dimensional data and can therefore handle images with thousands of pixels.
#### AdaBoost: 
Works by combining multiple "weak" classifiers into one "strong" classifier. Each weak classifier is trained on a subset of the data, and the algorithm assigns higher weights to the misclassified data points. The next weakest classifier is then trained on the updated data set, with the weights reflecting the difficulty of classifying each data point.
#### KNN:  
It classifies new data points based on the majority class of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space.
#### Clusetring:
Is a method used to group similar objects based on their characteristics or attributes. We will be able to use for classifying and compressing images. We will group similar images based on their visual attributes such as color, texture and shape. In addition to grouping similar pixels and representing them with a single value.

### Through all these we were able to answer and reach the answers we were looking for before.
